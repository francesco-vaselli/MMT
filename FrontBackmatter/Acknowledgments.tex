\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
I am most grateful to all the people who studied with me during these years, helping me understand something new as well as providing a constant source of motivation and inspiration.
I would like to thank my family, especially my mother Maria, my father Marco and my sister Marta for always beings supportive of myself and of my choices.
My supervisor has to be thanked as well, for keeping me on track and pushing me towards results that at first I did not think possible. Many thanks to Dr. Nadya Chernyavskaya of CERN for her invaluable comments which saved me a lot of time and mistakes.

Finally, I must thank Dr. Stephen Green for his outstanding work on Normalizing Flows for likelihood-free inference and for making it publicly available. Without it, this Thesis would be something very different (and certainly worse!). My dear friend and colleague Lucia Papalini deserves an honorary mention for introducing me, albeit rather indirectly, to that piece of work.
